This homework assignment dealt with combining Python and Fortran.
Fortran was used as the computing engine, Python as the instructor.

For this homework assignment, I split up the directories as instructed.
One directory holds all the Fortran files, one holds the Python script.
The makefile was adjusted in order to fully clean the files.

Run my code doing:
python pyRun/pyRun_rootFinder.py

My code will execute for 3 different thresholds as specified.
It will also execute for a close and a far initial guess.
