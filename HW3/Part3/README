The following files have been provided to approximate pi in a modular fashion.

* definition.h			Provides global definitions
* pi_driver.F90			Driver program for approximating pi
* pi_writeOutput.F90		Generates output file for history arrays
* setup_module.F90		Gathers input information and sets up variables
* makefile			Compilation: executable, debug, clean
* pi_module.F90			Provides subroutines needed for algorithm
* plotInstructions.txt		Instructions for generating GNUplot
* pi_approx.init		Input file with runtime parameters
* piPlot.png			One of the plots showing pi convergence
* read_initFile_module.F90	Dongwook's file for reading init file


Instructions for running my code:
Use the makefile (make) to compile and obtain an executable.
Run executable - it will print summary to screen if convergence is met.
  It will also generate an output file holding n,pi approximation,residual,
  and the threshold.
Use the makefile (make clean) to remove the excess clutter.
